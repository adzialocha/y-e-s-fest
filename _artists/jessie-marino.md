Jessie is a composer/performer/media artist from Long Island, New York. Her current work explores the virtuosity of common activities, ritualistic absurdity, and the archeology of recent media. Her pieces rigorously score out sound, physical movements, lighting and staging and place them within highly organized time structures and musical formats.
