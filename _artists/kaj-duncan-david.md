Kaj is a composer making music with computers, instruments, performers, light and video. Light as a musical material is an important aspect of his work and he is particularly focused on exploring the possibility of a point where interrelated visual and sonic materials become a single musical gestalt. Many of his pieces are written on commission from musicians and ensembles. He also works in music-theatre contexts and sometimes makes music for dance. His pieces are regularly presented at international festivals for new music. Whilst completing degrees in sound art, electronic music and scenic composition at Goldsmiths in London, DIEM (the Danish Institute for Electronic Music) in Aarhus, and the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Dresden he studied with, among others, Simon Steen-Andersen and Manos Tsangaris.
