Based in Vienna, is a visual and performance artist and she mostly works with interventions in public space, performance, installation, video and drawing. Inspired by daily life situations her work is often process based. Many works are concerned with sleep and consciousness, private and public, fake and reality, and borders of legal and illegal. Recently she started researching the subject of sleep in general and the subject of lucid dreaming in particular.
