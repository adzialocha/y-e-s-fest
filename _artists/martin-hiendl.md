Martin Hiendl is a composer and performer, working between concert music, performance, music theater, installation and other interdisciplinary realms, exploring the performativity of the space-time-body relationship in music as a live actâ€”as a shared space in time between bodies for an event that is inherently theatrical. His works have been performed by ensembles and performers from the Zafraan Ensemble (Berlin), Kammerensemble Neue Musik (Berlin), International Contemporary Ensemble (New York), JACK Quartet (New York), and others. The opera installation PARADISE was premiered at musikprotokoll / steirischer herbst 2016. Since 2015 he is pursuing a doctorate at Columbia University in New York with George E. Lewis.
