Sam is a composer, pianist and multimedia artist whose work spans a wide range of musical idioms.  As a pianist he has collaborated closely with composers as an interpreter of new works, and with improvisers in contexts where the boundaries between composed and improvised music are porous and easily traversed.  Yulsman has performed and recorded in the United States and Europe, with recent and performances of new works including the premieres of Kenji Sakai’s Fanfare Towards the Dusk at the Music From Japan Festival 2017, and Chris Pitsiokos’ Working from Postcards is Good Enough If You Are Francis Picabia at Art for Art’s 2017 festival, Justice is Compassion/Not a Police State. As a composer, Yulsman’s work has been performed by ensembles including Ensemble Korea, the New York New Music Ensemble, Rage Thormbones, JACK Quartet, Wet Ink Ensemble and Mivos Quartet. His work has been performed at Ostrava Days (2017), the Pacific Rim Music Festival (2017), the 2016 Wet Ink Large Ensemble Readings, and the Columbia Composers and Columbia Sound Arts Electroacoustic Concert (2015 and 2017).
