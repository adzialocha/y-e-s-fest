These are imaginary pieces of music. The imaginary can reflect the impossible back on itself and make it possible, imaginable. Music may also imply light, thought, premise - and encourages an active participation of the imagination and an extension of a mode of hearing. From this space we trace new extensions of a periphery of listening - noticing the boundaries separating the outside and inside of habit. Hearing and Feeling become one. In these three excerpts, we create different scenarios for your imagination to perform. A public audience is not necessary. Simply find a space where your imagination can wander, and use this music to begin a new path in your cognitive landscape.
