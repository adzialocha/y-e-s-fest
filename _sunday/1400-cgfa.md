Together we will learn how to play the Cybernetic Gamelan Future Automaton, this will lead to a performance later in the day. The Cybernetic Gamelan Future Automaton is a network-based browser game for human laptop performers. Each performer controls its own future-gamelan instrument using text symbols while travelling inside a 3D universe of parametric architectures, visualizing how algorithms generate and represent knowledge. Based on a network which is prone to latency, and noisy gamelan- inspired synthesizer textures, the Automaton reflects the culture of computing which appears both alien in its clean and infinite shapes and rich of error, latency and noise of human input at the same time.
