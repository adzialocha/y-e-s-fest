We perform with our selfmade human windchime costumes. Human windchimes are nature sprites, of a nature that includes what we usually overlook and discard. Trash, in reconstituted form, returns to haunt its past homes. The feeling is of an alien world overlaying the everyday environment. The alien world is composed of mundane objects, but maintains a separate sensibility and internal discipline. Human windchimes neither avoid public contact, nor court an audience reaction like a ball team mascot. They are on an epic journey to seek out the sounding potential of the space they are in. They inhabit the space and resonate its hidden music â€“ conversing with, but not bound by, its everyday use.
