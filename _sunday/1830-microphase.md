microphase is an investigation into the phasing of samplers on a micro-level. 3 piano samples of 100, 100.5 and 101 milliseconds, panned center, left and right, are continuously looped, while the read-point of the samplers is incrementally changing and wrapped around the sampling window, so that each sampler returns to read-point 0 after 900 iterations. One cycle of the 3 samples without the read-point interpolation is 33 minutes and 50.1 seconds. The phasing of all processes involved results in a cycle of 21 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes and 30 seconds until the texture starts repeating itself.
