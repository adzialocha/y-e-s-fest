still arriving is a performance installation for one pianist and electronics. Its open notation invites the performers to make — speaking with Donna Haraway — string figures with the compositional idea, the software framework and the context of the live performance. The heart of the piano part is a simple live­electronic circuit: four delay lines à five seconds turn musical scales of different speed, range and direction into slowly changing chords — into the chamber­musical simultaneity of different pasts.
