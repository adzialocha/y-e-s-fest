451 proposes, among other things, an intuitive approach to music making, humbly inspired by the energy and approach to the guitar of improvisers such as Julia Reidy, Derek Bailey and Fred Frith. The notation aims to give the performer a certain rhythmic freedom, in search of an immediate and spontaneous flow, as opposed to being bound to a strict and unwavering timecode. As such - and furthermore - any one wishing to play the piece is encouraged to be creative with their interpretation.
