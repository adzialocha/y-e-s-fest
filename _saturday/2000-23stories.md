“23 stories on losing my breath” is a performance for voices, double bass and electronics. Using both pre-composed and improvised material, the performers interact with each other in different formations, presenting a succession of short moments that shape volatile ideas of narration through sound and image, like expanded shots from a stopmotion film.
